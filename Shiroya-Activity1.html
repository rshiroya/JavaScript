<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><b>Rhytham Shiroya</b> is a senior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
My concentration is CyberSecurity. I love travelling to new places; Smoky Mountains is my favorite place for a quick getaway from the busy schedule. My hobbies includes listening to music, watching Netflix, and occasional gaming.</p>

<p><em><b> I</b> am taking this class to learn advance level HTML, CSS and use them to build website.</em></p>

<p>I am planning to spend more time behind the class and use w3schools as reference.</p>
